## Introdction:-

This is my second project in the professional track, and I hope that I have succeeded in completing this project with the conditions to be implemented, and that this project will be as the user thinks.

## Some Information about this project:-

- I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
- while writing app.js file I used the ES6.

- I added an extention to the URL `&units=metric` for geting temperature in Celsius.

## How to use this app:-

I think that using this project will be very easy for any user. All that the user has to provide to start using this project is to provide the pagecode of the country whose weather you want to show its weather and also enter your feelings or how you feel for this day and then press the button called Generate, then it will appear to you Temperature, date and your feeling that you entered
